Spring profiles
spring provides a great tool for grouping congiguration properties into so-called profiels(dev,qa,prod)
allowing us to activate a bunch of configurations based on the active profile


profiles are perfect for setting up our application for different environments, but they are also being used in another
use cases like bean creationon basesd on a profile etc

so  basically a profile can influence the applcation properties loaded and beans which are loaded into the spring context
